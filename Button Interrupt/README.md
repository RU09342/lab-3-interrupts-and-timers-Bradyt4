# Button interrupt

## Tyler Brady

## Background
* This project consisted of designing code capable of changing LED states when a button was pressed by using
an interrupt. This project simply used a interrupt to stop the main function of the processor to XOR the output
of the LED, either toggling it on or off.

## Devices
* MSP430G2553
* MSP430FR2311
* MSP430FR5994
* MSP430FR6989
* MSP430F5529

## Differences
* The main differences between the different processors is similar to most of the other projects where it is just
a change in which input/output ports are used.

## Extra work
* NONE
